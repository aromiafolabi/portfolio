        Hi, my name is Aromi. I am a full stack developer from London. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My previous role as an advisor enabled me to develop skills in negotiations, 
        policy developement, strategy, project management and delivery.
        Over the course of my time at my previous role, I was instrumental in the signing of 2 trade deals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving into web development was a natural progression for me as i have always been interested in technology and self taught in my spare time.
        I wanted to immerse myself more into software development, 
        so i enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly, 
        which has been a great way for me to combine the skills obtained at my previous role and technical skills.
